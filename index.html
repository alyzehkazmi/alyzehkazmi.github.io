                </h1>
                <p>When I got home from school that day, my grandmother greeted me with a plate of cookies and a worried expression. I hadn't received the scholarship I needed to go to ballet camp, and we'd need to find another way to earn the money. That's when I started my business giving dance lessons to preschoolers, and it's taught me a lot about how to solve problems on my own.</p>
